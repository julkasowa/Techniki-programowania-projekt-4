# The program is supposed to simulate how robotic arm is placing geometric figures on top of each other
Arm is operated by addition or substraction of angles. Angle1 is between first arm and ground and Angle2 is an angel for second arm.

Pick and drop button are responsible for picking up the figure and later droping it at designated place. 

There is posibility of choosing different shapes, while speed can also be adjusted by speed+ and speed- buttnons.
